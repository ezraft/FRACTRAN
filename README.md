## Swap
Task: write a program that swaps register $2$ with register $3$ (i.e given $2^k$, return $3^k$).

Code:

```2/3```

## Addition

Task: write a program that takes two inputs in registers $2$ and $3$, and adds them, placing the result in register $5$ (i.e. given $2^k$ and $3^\ell$, return $5^{k+\ell}$).

Code:
```5/2 5/3```

## Multiplication

Task: write a program that takes two inputs in registers $2$ and $3$, and multiplies them, placing the result in register $5$ (i.e. given $2^k$ and $3^\ell$, return $5^{k+\ell}$).

Code:
```5/2 5/3```
